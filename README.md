# Mamba Documentation

This repository contains the documentation of the [mamba](https://github.com/JSAbrahams/mamba) language.
It contains both the informal description of the language and a formal specification.

We will be accepting contributions soon once we have everything set up!

Eventually, it would be nice host a webpage here so that the documentation of the language is easily accessible.
At the moment the repository consists mostly of markdown files with jotted down ideas and rough descriptions of features.
