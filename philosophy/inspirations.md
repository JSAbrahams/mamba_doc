# General inspirations of the language

The following is a list of programming languages that inspired this one in one way or another. 
This can either be certain constructs or keywords in the language, or the philosophy of the language as a whole.
It should be noted that this is based on my personal experience with these languages.
It may be that a certain feature of a certain language did inspire a certain feature of Mamba, but that does not mean that another language does not contain said feature, only that I encountered it there first.

Language  | Inspired
----------|------------
Python    | Flexibility. Co-existence of functional and oop paradigms. Large portions of the syntax.
Java      | OOP concepts. Static typing rules.
C#        | OOP concepts. Static typing rules and type inference.
Scala     | That everything is an object, including primitives of the language. Pattern Matching.
Kotlin    | Ranges baked into the language. Type aliases. Covariance and Contravariance using `in` and `out`.
Ada       | Custom data types (or type aliases) with ranges, which also inspired use of type refinement. Use of natural language over symbols, such as using `and` as opposed to `&&`.
C++       | OOP concepts and operator overloading.
C         | General programming concepts. Not so much a direct inspiration but more a general influence.
Eiffel    | Design by contract philosophy andthe `retry` keyword. Design by contract also inspired the type refinement system. 
Haskell   | Pattern Matching. Immutability. Closeness of mapping with mathematical notation, for instance set constructor notation.
Rust      | Error handling mechanisms and strict rules regarding mutability.
Ruby      | Portions of the syntax of the language.
Swift     | Elegant error handling mechanisms.
Go        | Error handling mechanisms, which encourage error handling on site.
MATLAB    | Small portions of the syntax. 
SmallTalk | OOP concepts, with a large emphasis on program state.
JavaScript| Interchangeability of variables and functions, and a reliance on higher-order functions.
Perl      | The `forward` keyword.

My experience with each language varies greatly, from having used it on a near daily basis, to only having read about it online and only have a conceptual understanding of its workings.
Below I outline a bit what each language aims to do, and how well I believe that it achieves these goals.
The groupings might seem somewhat arbitrary to the reader, and to some extent it is.
I grouped them mostly by what I perceived to be their intended design goals.

## Python, JavaScript, Perl, and Ruby

These are the scripting languages, and have proved to be very popular in the domain of web development.

## C, Rust, Go, and Ada

These are imperative programming languages.

## Java, C#, and C++

These are the historically famous object oriented languages.

## Kotlin, Swift, and Scala

These new generation of object oriented programming languages which aim to improve upon the above.

## Smalltalk and Eiffel

Languages which aim to implement object oriented programming in its "purest" form.

## MATLAB

A somewhat peculiar language, it is aimed at matrix manipulation.
It is a language that shows how much an ecosystem can define the language in which it resides.

## Haskell

The only purely functional programming language on this list.
