# 1.4 Flexibility

In addition to readability of source code, a language should provide a nice balance between rigorousness and flexibility.
A language should be flexible enough for developers to express their ideas in a clear precise manner.
Ideally, a developer should not have to jump through loops to write up their ideas in code.
A language should however not introduce too much ambiguity, which for instance can happen when there is too much syntax sugar present, allowing for multiple ways of doing the same (trivial) thing.

Truth be told, flexibility is more of an illusion when it comes to programming languages.
No matter what way you spin it, a language is a collection of strictly defined grammar and semantic rules.
Computers operate using well-defined instructions, which by their nature are unambigious.
A programming language serves as a bridge between these instructions and human speech.
It is not quite as natural (and thankfully not as ambiguous) as human speech, but it is not quite as rigorous (and unreadable) as machine instructions.

Where a language lies on this spectrum varies greatly however.
Loosely speaking, languages closer to human speech are often regarded as "high level" languages, whereas languages closer to machine level instructions are often regarded as "low level" langauges.
