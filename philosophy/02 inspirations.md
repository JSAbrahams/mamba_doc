# General inspirations of the language

The following is a list of programming languages that inspired this one in one way or another. This can either be
certain constructs or keywords in the language, or the philosophy of the language as a whole.

Language  | Inspired
----------|------------
Python    | Flexibility. Co-existence of functions and methods, or co-existence of functional and oop paradigms. Large portion of the syntax.
Java      | OOP concepts. Strict typing rules.
C#        | OOP concepts.
Scala     | Everything is an object, including primitives of the language, pattern matching.
Kotlin    | Ranges. Type aliases, relying in keywords to define common use cases instead of having to write everything out explicitly.
Ada       | Custom data types (or type aliases) with ranges. Inspired use of type refinement. Strict typing rules. Natural language over symbols, such using `and` stead of `&&`.
C++       | OOP concept.
C         | General programming concepts, not so much a direct inspiration but a general influence.
Eiffel    | Design by contract philosophy, the `retry` keyword. Design by contract inspired used of type refinement. 
Haskell   | Pattern Matching. Lack of mutability. Closeness of mapping with mathematical notation, for instance set constructor notation.
Rust      | Error handling mechanisms. Strict rules regarding mutability.
Ruby      | Syntax sugar, postfix `if` operator. Philosophy that flexibility is not inherently a bad thing.
Swift     | Error handling mechanisms.
Go        | Error handling mechanisms, encouraging error handling on site.
MATLAB    | Concepts of flexibility, certain syntax.
SmallTalk | OOP concepts, emphasis on program state.
JavaScript| Interchangeability of variables and functions. Flexibility.
COBOL     | Use of natural language for clarity. But nowhere to the same extent.
Perl      | The `forward` keyword.

My experience with each language varies greatly, from having used it on a near daily basis, to only having read about it online and only have a conceptual understanding of its workings.
Below I outline a bit what each language aims to do, and how well I believe that it achieves these goals.
The groupings might seem somewhat arbitrary to the reader, and to some extent it is.
I grouped them mostly by what I perceived to be their intended design goals.

## Python, JavaScript, Perl, and Ruby

These are the scripting languages, and have proved to be very popular in the domain of web development.

## C
 
The father of most modern programming languages.
 
## Rust, Go, and Ada

These languages, much like C, are aimed at embedded systems, but provide some extra features.

## Java, C#, and C++

These are the historically famous object oriented languages.

## Kotlin, Swift, and Scala

These new generation of object oriented programming languages aim to improve on the above.

## Smalltalk and Eiffel

Languages which aim to implement object oriented programming in its "purest" form.

## MATLAB

A somewhat peculiar language, it is aimed at matrix manipulation.
It is a language that shows how much an ecosystem can define the language in which it resides.

## Haskell

The only purely functional programming language on the list.
