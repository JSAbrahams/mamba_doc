# Type

A type describes the properties a value of that type should have. Each such property is a definition. A definition is
then either a method or a immutable variable. Only classes can implement types.

Say I have a server, I could define the type as follows:

```
    type Server
    
    def name: String?

    def connect:      IPAddress -> Boolean
    def send_message: String -> Boolean
    def disconnect:   _ -> Boolean
```

Now any class that implements this type must have these definitions.
