## Introduction

A module is one of the following:

Module   | Description
---------|--------------
Script   | A sequence of Instructions.
Type     | A blueprint for a class, defines the behaviour of a class.
Statless or stateful    | A blueprint for an instance of an object. Defines the behaviour of that object, and may implement a type.

A file may contain either a script accompanied by functions, or a mix of types, utils and classes. 
Furthermore, it is generally best to have at most one type per file for readability sake.
