# Control Flow Expressions

### If Expressions (or Statements)

If expressions are perhaps one of the most well known and universal programming constructs.

### When Expressions (or Statements)

A when can be used match based on the value of an expression.

We can even match based on the type of the returned expression.

Notice that certain functions can be rewritten without a when, by using the default behaviour feature of the language.
