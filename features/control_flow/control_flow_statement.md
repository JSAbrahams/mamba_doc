# 2.1.2 Control Flow Statements

### While Statements

A while is useful when we want to execute a statement or expression, or block, multiple times as long as a certain condition holds.

### Foreach Statements

A `foreach` loop is useful when we want to iterate over items in a collection.

We can also do the following:

    foreach i in 0..10 do print i
    
Which will print all numbers from `0` to `9`. 
Type `Int`, which is a `ClosedRange[Int]`, can be used in this manner using the `..` notation.
It also possible to use a custom type `T` in this manner. 
In this case it should implement `ClosedRange[T]`, and define the following method:

    to_range (from: T, to: T): List[T]
